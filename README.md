# IoT Kit Samples

Samples illustrating how to develop applications on the IoT Kit platform. 

> Note: this repo should be treated as public. Samples will eventually be made available to the wider audience. 

While the list of applications one could develop on this platform is endless, the samples listed in this repo demonstrate how to collect data from connected sensors, format it and relay that data to the Cloud portion of IoT Kit for analytics: MapReduce, SQL-based query or a simple download for off-line processing.

These samples focus on three specific activities:

* sensor reading
* message formatting 
* and connectivity to Cloud

For detail instructions on access of your data in the Cloud please see the [wiki](https://github.com/enableiot/iotkit-samples/wiki)
